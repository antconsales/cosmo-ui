# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

Run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset. This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Versioning and Publishing

When ready to release:

1. Run `pnpm version-packages` to bump versions and update changelogs
2. Commit the changes
3. Run `pnpm release` to publish to npm

## Linked Packages

All Cosmo UI packages are linked, meaning they will be versioned together:
- @cosmo/core-schema
- @cosmo/validator
- @cosmo/renderer-web
- @cosmo/renderer-ar
- @cosmo/renderer-meta
- @cosmo/ai-adapter
